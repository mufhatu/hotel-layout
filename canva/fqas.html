<h3>Accommodation – Searching</h3>
<p>How do I search for a suitable hotel or apartment for my stay?<br>

It is very easy. At first type (enter) name of your destination/hotel including date of your stay into the blue "Search box". Than just click on red button "Search". Immediately, all the available rooms will show up including prices for whole stay (number of nights you filled previously). You can also use our filters for more specific accommodation request as price per room, star rating, hotel type, facilities etc. On the top of the page you can also sort the accommodation based on popularity, price per room, guest rating and distance from center. You can also select a suitable accommodation on the map located on our home page – all hotels are listed there together with all the main attractions. This is quite helpful if you do not know the destination much but wish to stay close to a certain attraction.
